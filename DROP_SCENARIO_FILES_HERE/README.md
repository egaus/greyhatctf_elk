In order to load a scenario, copy and paste the associated .tar.gz file here, from the "scenarios" directory to this directory.  If you copy multiple files, they will be each loaded one after another and only one of the files will have it's logs loaded into the Elastic Stack.

If you inadvertently move the file, rather than copy it, it will be deleted and you will need to retrieve the scenario from the git repo again.
